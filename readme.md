Task Details:
Start at ERIK’S Homepage. Pretend you know nothing about bikes. Find an Electric Bike that would work for a 5’11” individual that can be picked up at our Burnsville location.  Get to the Payment section of Checkout (no need to place an order). Capture a screenshot of the cart. Describe any roadblocks you encountered and how you think the discovery/purchase flow can be improved.

Start at Shred Shop Homepage. Pretend you know nothing about snowboards. Find a Snowboard, Boots and Bindings set-up that would work for you personally and proceed through checkout to get these shipped to you (stop at Payment section, no need to place an order). Capture a screenshot of the cart. Describe any roadblocks you encountered and how you think the discovery/purchase flow can be improved.

In the attached zipped folder are assets and a wireframe for a very basic sample web page. Please use this as a guide to build a working web page. This can either be hosted in an environment you have access to (in which case send me the url), or you can send me all the source code once complete. A few notes on this task:

- The Wireframe is intentionally a very rough draft. Feel free to use your UX and Dev skills to make this the best page you can
- The final page and assets should be fully optimized for a high performing responsive web page
- The final section of the wireframe is open to allow you to create and implement a cool feature that you feel would be engaging for our customers

Once you are done with these tasks, please email me the following:
- Notes from Task 1 and 2 including screenshots of the cart
- URL or Source Code for Task 3
- Notes from Task 3 about why you built the page as you did and any other relevant information I should know about the final page
